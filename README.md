  The solution involves creating a login page to obtain the sender's private key. Once logged in, a random private key is generated and associated with the sender. The client signs the transaction with the private key, amount, and recipient address, which is validated on the server by recovering the public key from the signature. Input validations and component styling are also implemented.
