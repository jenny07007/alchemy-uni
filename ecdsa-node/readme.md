## ECDSA Node

This project is an example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses. Since there is just a single server on the back-end handling transfers, this is clearly very centralized. We won't worry about distributed consensus for this project.

However, something that we would like to incoporate is Public Key Cryptography. By using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures we can make it so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the associated address.

### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `node index` to start the server

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically!

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.

### Solution

1. Create a login page to get the sender's private key. In real projects, it will connect the sender's wallet to that kind of thing.
2. When the sender logs in, create a random private key that associates with the sender.
3. Sign the transaction with the sender's private key, amount, and recipient address. I do this on the client, which is **insecure**.
4. Received signature from the client, recover public key on the server. So, if the pubkey from the signature is the same as the pubkey we got from the wallet, the sender can send $ to other addresses.
5. Inputs validations & components styling
